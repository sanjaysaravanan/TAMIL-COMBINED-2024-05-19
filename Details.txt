1. Node JS npm project, so we can install external packages
    1. Create a project for the backend
    2. npm install <package-name>

2. HTTP Server:

    http --> protocol used to serve files or data via internet

    basic server creation using http create server

    Disadvantages:
      http: does not provide wide variety of function to support operations like,

        1. body parsing
        2. changing http methods
        3. handling middlewares
        4. proper routing logic is not possible

      We need to manually handle it with a lots of codes

3. Deploying a nodejs application using render.com
      1. Publish codes to Github
      2. Log in render.com
      3. New Web Service
      4. Choose Repo
      5. Configure proper cmds
          1. build cmd ---> npm install
          2. Start Command ---> whatever the script that You want to run
      6. Deploy ( Watch out for any errors in the deployment process)

4. Express:
    APIs using express -
    why express external module:
        basic server creation is possible in normal nodejs that involves lot of code with lots of built-in packages
    
        Express combines everything and puts together in simple terms

    web framework http server applcation which lets us create APIs
    in fast and simple ways

4.1: POST-Man

    Tool used to access different API Methods like below,
      1. GET
      2. POST
      3. PUT
      4. DELETE

5. CRUD Operations with APIs
   CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE

6. URL Params:
    Path Params: /:id

        id or name is the path variable/param
      request.params

      param is *id*
    
    Query Params: comes after question mark
      request.query
      /todos?deleteId=100
      param is *deleteId*

7. Request is an object with pre-defined key<->value pairs & methods/functions
    used to operate on top of the request in-coming

    Eg: request.body gives the payload, 
    
    Below are created by expressjs,
      req.params['<param-name>'] gives the path param. request.query will give the query param

8. Resposne:
    response is an object with pre-defined key<->value pairs & methods
    used to operate on top of the response out-going

    Express Created funcs,
      res.send();

Tasks:

  Day 33:
    Nodejs file system Task
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c_u6azHv7AQHse45GGcrCRe78liwv90S5aHwBR7tBP0/edit

    Q1:
      Write an api ( POST ) with express which will create a file
      sample-folder/2023-12-02T06:38:44.231Z.txt --> 178979789489386 

      use writeFileSync

      send back proepr repsonse using res.send
    
    Q2:
      write an api ( GET ) with express which will retrieve all the files

      use readdirSync

      send back proepr repsonse( file names ) using res.send

  Day 34: ( Optional - if possible just create the express server and simple crud apis for rooms )

    Nodejs hall booking api task
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rwPQ2LbHtMZajA_GIZfR-Ko2MFueoT82AmfHTK9V-hM/edit

    Entities:
      /rooms ( CRUD )
      /bookings ( CRUD )
      /customers ( CRUD )

    Send the responses appropriately using if else blocks

    Right now write all the apis for CRUD (rooms)

    realational APIs will discuss next week
